## Final Assignment - Getting and Cleaning Data

### Summary
In this repo you'll find the files submitted for the week 4 assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
For the code to work, you'll need to download the data and then unzip it into your working directory manually.
The code will generate a tidy data set as defined in the assignment.
Specifically, the students were asked to:

1. Merge the training and test sets
2. Extract only the mean and standard deviation values of each measurement type
3. Assign names to the activities (activity lables provided in the data set)
4. Name the columns properly (descriptive variable names) 
5. Create an independent tidy data set that contains the mean of the remaining sensor values
   for every activity and subject

### Provided Data
The provided data contains - among others:

1. the sensor signals (files starting with "X_")
2. the activities (represented by a number) undertaken while sensor data was captured (files starting with "y_")
3. the list of test/training subjects (represented by a number, files starting with "subject_")

### Created tidy dataset
The generated data set consists of the calculated mean of each variable grouped by activity type and student
